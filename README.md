# Unknown Language

This project is the beginning phase of the implementation of a new statically typed, imperative programming language. Currently, this language does not have a name. The language will be implemented with a bytecode compiler and stack-based virtual machine to interpret the bytecode.

> Development is occuring on the [dev branch](https://github.com/davimiku/unknown-lang/tree/dev)

## Project Status

This project is not yet in a workable state. The skeleton of the lexer, parser, AST, symbol resolution, type checker, bytecode generator, and virtual machine have been set up and implemented for value literals and basic variable definitions. The first merge to `main` is planned when function definitions and function calls have been implemented for all phases.
